 * Validaion ...
 * Blog (http://blog.vavr.io/vavr-one-log-02/): An actual problem is that our Validation type does not scale very well. We are able to combine up to eight validation results,
 * our maximum function arity, which is not sufficient in many cases. My take on solving this problem is to either find an API
 * that does not rely on functions of high arity or remove the Validation type from the library. (to be continued)
